# Claude Mastery Project Configuration
# =====================================
# Define reusable profiles for /new-project
#
# Usage:
#   /new-project my-app clean            → Claude infrastructure only, zero coding opinions
#   /new-project my-app default          → creates at ~/projects/my-app with full opinionated stack
#   /new-project my-app api              → creates at ~/projects/my-app with API profile
#   /new-project ./custom/path my-app    → explicit path overrides root_dir
#   /new-project my-app default vercel   → profile + override
#
# Global settings:
#   root_dir:        Default parent directory for new projects
#                    If just a project name is given (no path), it creates at root_dir/<name>
#                    Override by passing an explicit path (./foo, ~/bar, /abs/path)
#
# Profile values:
#   type:            webapp | api | fullstack | cli
#   framework:       vite | next | astro | fastify | express | hono
#   hosting:         dokploy | vercel | static
#   package_manager: pnpm | npm | bun
#   database:        mongo | postgres | sqlite | none
#   analytics:       rybbit | none
#   options:         seo, ssr, tailwind, prisma, docker, ci, multiregion
#   mcp:             playwright, context7, rulecatch
#   npm:             additional npm packages to install (comma-separated)
#
# Customize these profiles to match YOUR preferred stack.
# Global fallback: ~/.claude/claude-mastery-project.conf

[clean]
# All Claude Code infrastructure, zero coding opinions.
# You get: .claude/ (commands, skills, agents, hooks), project-docs templates,
#           CLAUDE.md (security rules only), .env pattern, .gitignore, tests/ templates.
# You DON'T get: TypeScript enforcement, port assignments, database wrapper,
#                testing frameworks, quality gates, API versioning, SEO rules.
# Your project, your rules. Claude just works.
